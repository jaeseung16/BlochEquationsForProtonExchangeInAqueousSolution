#Bloch equations for proton exchange reactions in an aqueous solution

The MATLAB codes to produce Figures 1, 2, and 4 in Ref. [1].

The following are some corrections for the errors in Ref. [1].

- In the 4th paragraph of Section 6, '10pKa - 15.7' should be '10pKa - 15.7'.
- In Eq. (38), HPO42- should not be boldfaced.
- In Section 9, there are two citations of Figure 5D. They should be Figure 5F.
