#### The following are some corrections for the errors in Ref. [1].
1. In the 4th paragraph of Section 6, '10<sup>pK<sub>a</sub></sup> - 15.7' should be '10<sup>pK<sub>a</sub> - 15.7</sup>'.
2. In Eq. (38), HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> should not be boldfaced.
3. In Section 9, there are two citations of Figure 5D. They should be Figure 5F.
